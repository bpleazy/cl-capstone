# Code Louisville Capstone Project

The purpose of this project is to display my ability to design a web page. I've learned how to use some JavaScript, I've gotten familiar with HTML5, and CSS3.
<br>
I for sure need to study JavaScript in more depth; I was able to generate some interesting CSS selectors and pseudo-elements; appending text directly into the HTML file will be even more powerful for web applications than simply using CSS to add content using selectors and pseudo-elements/classes.
<br>
Navigation menus are important to me, and I'm pretty proud of the one used on this web page. Although, there is one thing that bothers me; at a very particular screen width between the mobile break-point and tablet breakpoint, all of my drop-down menus toggle at once. I made a change since the first iteration, but I can't quite seem to make this bug disappear.
<br>
My original intention with this project was to generate a game web-app similar to the ones in the menu links, but with my own set of rules for an Online-Multiplayer mode. We play this game a lot at work, and it's become so highly competitive that I crave an unbiased, programmatic, instantaneous referee to govern the gameplay. The game is SET, and as you can see if you look around in the resources provided in the "Theory" tab, I ran into a pretty hard snag while attempting to write the data model and logic for the JavaScript program. I intend to one day finish the game, but I'm going to have to take some time to take a calculated approach to build a model around it and write the parameters and logic in a way that will execute rapidly.
<br>
I really hope this game picks up in popularity; It's incredibly addictive.

## All you need to do to view the page is download all the files and run index.html.

- [x] responsive to different devices and/or browser sizes/resolutions.
- [x] user experience changes to improve as screen size or device viewing changes.
- [x] at least 1 front-end framework (jQuery, Bootstrap)
- [x] comments in code
- [x] project code is on GitHub account in its own repository.
- [x] include a README file located at the top level directory of your project providing the following:
    - [x] brief description of your projectâ€™s purpose
    - [x] detailed steps on how to view the website, can be [Github Pages]()
    - [x]


My design has multiple breakpoints in CSS for different screen sizes, so that content will display optimally across different devices. I also JavaScript for my responsive top-nav. Each of the buttons in the nav has a drop-down menu, and in tablet view the links are centered on the nav. In mobile device view, there's then a "hamburger" button to toggle a fuller slide-down menu.<br>
I just realized, however, that I should have put all of the other files in a directory level or two above the index.html file, so that if/when I store the files on my domain, nothing but index.html will be public-facing. Oh well. It's on GitHub, anyway.
# Oh, and learn how to play SET. It's awesome.
